Ety
===

Ety is the, in my opinion, more user friendly www.etymologiebank.nl. I like to research the etymology of Dutch words. I do like the contents of www.etymologiebank.nl but I don't like their way of searching for a word. So I made it easier to navigate. This app is a wrapper around www.etymologiebank.nl and a scraper in one. To not bother them with continuous (re)searches of myself, I decided to scrape it with each newly searched word and store it in a mongodb.

Technologies used:

* Angular
* Mongoose / Mongodb
* NodeJS
* jsdom
* Express with Jade
